Here are some example scripts to run in Shell.

1. Using Pandoc to convert a Docx to txt:
	pandoc -s file.docx -o file.txt

   To keep the in-document comments from Docx
	pandoc --track-changes=all file.docx -o file .txt


2. Using Git to create a local repository:
	git init

   To add file(s) to the local repository:
	git add <file>

   To check the status of the current working tree of your repository in a 'staging area'. This will allow you to see what has been modified before you decide to commit them:
	git status

   To commit changes to your local repository. With this command you will be taken to the text
   editor in Shell. Press 'i', write whatever you want as the commit message, then press 'esc' then
   'wq' to commit the change to your local repository and to quit the text editor in Shell:
	git commit

   To connect your local repository to an online repository:
   Go to GitHub.com and create a new repository. Once created a setup page will appear with a list of commands.
   There will be a section named '...or create a new repositry on the command line'. In that section there will be two commands you are intereste in:
	git remote add origin <URL>
        git push -u origin master
   The first command will connect your local repository with the repository you just made on GitHub.
   The second command will push (upload) your local repository to the online repository.
