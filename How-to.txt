This is a manual for Jeremy Amin's PoC for FOAR705.

In this manual you will learn how to:

1. Convert Docx files which include in-document comments to other file formats eg Plain Text and retain the in document comments from the Docx file.
2. Save mutliple versions of your Docx file and the Plain Text file in a directory (folder) locally on your computer or laptop.
3. Syncronise the locally saved directory (folder) to an online repository, guaranteeing you will never lose your documents.
4. View all of the versions of your uploaded documents from any computer with an internet connection.
5. View all of the changes between versions of your uploaded documents in a way that you can compare one version with another. This is especially useful for the in-document Docx comments which you converted. Rather than needing Word to view and track comments on your work, you can view the comments in a way which allows for quick and easy comparisons for multiple versions of your work.

NOTE: This manual assumes you already have Microsoft Word and BASH installed on your computer.

TO BEGIN, YOU NEED TO DOWNLOAD:

Git from https://git-scm.com/
Pandoc from https://pandoc.org/

YOU NEED TO HAVE AN ACCOUNT ON:

https://github.com/

1. Use Shell in Terminal to use a program called 'Pandoc' to convert eg Docx files to Text files and vice versa.
2. Use Shell to use a program called 'Git' to version control a directoty (folder) of your choosing locally on your comuter or laptop and to also syncronise the same directory (folder) online.
3. Retain the comments from the Docx file when converting to md or txt so that the comments are visible in the md or txt file.
4. Create local and distributed version controlled repositories for your documents which will enable you to track all comments made to your Docx files.
5. 

The initial set up for everything is approximately 30 minutes depending on how well the user can navigate a computer, and especially Shell.
